## Advent of Code 2024

<!-- [Propose edits or changes on GitHub](link to GitHub repo of file) -->

I am terrible of thinking up my own "software project". I don't have much in
my own life that requires a constant stream of unique solutions.

Thinking that all elements of my own life requires a solution that needs
to be on the cloud and leverages generative AI is the same logical fallacy
that all problems can be resolved with a hammer... Well yes, but my gosh.
