## Advent of Code 2024

<!-- [Propose edits or changes on GitHub](link to GitHub repo of file) -->

I am terrible of thinking up my own "software projects". I don't have much in
my life that requires a constant stream of unique digital solutions.

Thinking that all elements of my own life requires a solution that needs
to be on the cloud and leverages generative AI is the same logical fallacy
that all problems can be resolved with a hammer... Well yes, but my gosh.

Like many times in the past, I'm diving into [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) again, drawn to the structure of a defined problem and the challenge of building a solution.

But this time, it's different. Unlike previous years, I’m no longer juggling the demands of work, school, and life.

Now that I’m graduated and employed, I have the privilege to focus on my career. I no longer need to _work to live_—instead, I get to _live to work_.

For me, the barrier to all this was earning that first degree. It’s a challenge many face, but one that’s worth it, as [research shows](https://www.ppic.org/publication/is-college-worth-it/#:~:text=Society%20benefits%20from%20higher%20education,-Higher%20education%20is&text=In%20addition%20to%20having%20higher,poverty%20or%20need%20social%20services.), both for personal growth and the broader social benefits it brings.

All developments in my journey of the previous, 2024, Advent of Code in Python
can be found here: <https://github.com/matt2ology/advent-of-code-2024-python>

### The goal

To avoid the trap of self-doubt and the spiral of frustration, I will set a small, manageable goal - something simple yet meaningful - to address my current gaps in knowledge.

1. Practice problem-solving with Python, without relying on GitHub Copilot.
2. Embrace Test-Driven Development (TDD):
   1. Write the test first - watch it fail.
   2. Implement a passing solution.
   3. Refactor the code (restructure without changing its functionality):
      1. Convert if-statements into functions.
      2. Group similar functions or modify shared variables into a class.
3. Learn and apply [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) as my testing framework.

If at any point I feel a sense of understanding, I’m under no obligation to continue - my goal is to practice, reflect, and document my progress.

Completing all of Advent of Code’s challenges is not the goal; for, the real aim is to emerge from this experience with more knowledge than I had before.

#### Stretch goals

These goals are ideally more attune to "someday-maybes" and no promise
to anyone or anybody else that I'll have them completed.

- Do the same practice in [Golang](https://go.dev/) and its environment
- Do the same practice in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and its environment
- Do the same, but practice using Python's own, built-in, `unittest`
- Do the same, but implement a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
