## Key Ideas

<!-- Idea 1: Key point or insights written in your own words -->

> When you move to a new city, start a new job, it feels like the very first day of freshman year — terrifying if you hardly know anyone.

New life events bring new fears, doubts, and uncertainty and includes
everything from a move to a new city, start of a new job, or an interest in
a new hobby.

> the game plan: Start with whoever you know — people from
> college, roommates, co-workers. Whatever's happening. Say yes. Go
> to the housewarmings, the happy hours, and the hikes, and just find
> that one friend you vibe with. Afterwards, ask them to hang out. This is a follow-through. It's critical! It's a meal, a coffee chat. This is where you go from NPC to, "Oh, you're a real person." if you don’t have hobbies, host something.

You'll hardly know anyone, so leverage your existing relationships. Ask
from people you've known from college, previous roommates, or even
your former or current co-workers. Go to the local events, the
housewarmings, work events, and/or happy hours and find that one
person you can connect and vibe with and ask to hangout. Go out for a
coffee, brunch, a walk around the farmers market. You already pass the
vibe test, so talk about your goals, hobbies, share life stories and
interests. If you don't have "hobbies" host a game or dinner night.

> Making friends is hard, but it's very doable. Remember to follow through, don't overthink it, give it time, make an effort, and you just might be surprised.

Everything for the first time in a new environment, or stage of life, is
hard. Give yourself grace and follow though. The amounts of time and
effort you put into any venture adds up and soon you'll find yourself at a
different state from when you first started.
