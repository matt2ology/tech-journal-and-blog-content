> This is a cartoon I found in a magazine several years ago, and I thought it was particularly poignant. The only valid measurement of code quality is WTFs per minute coming out from behind the door where the code review is taking place. And you look at the code, the door on the left, and you realize that's probably pretty good code, because there aren't that many WTFs coming out from behind that door. On the other hand, that door on the right must have some pretty bad code behind it, because there's a whole bunch of WTFs coming out from behind that door.

> Our society runs on software; nothing happens in our society without software nowadays. It didn't used to be that way; it wasn’t that way in the 1960s, wasn’t that way in the 70s, and wasn’t that way in the 80s. But today, our society runs on software. There is nothing you can do without software. You cannot buy anything, you cannot sell anything, you cannot pass a law, and you cannot enforce a law. You can’t get insurance policies, you can’t get claims from insurance policies, and you can’t get money out of the bank without software. Software runs everything, and our society does not yet realize just how deep it is on software.

A bunch of you, how fast can you go those first few days when there's no code? Someone comes to you and says, "Can you get a feature done?" And you think, "Yes!" You start writing code. Code pours out of every orifice of your body, and you get that feature working. And everybody goes, "Whoa! You got that working fast. It only took you a few days!" We're programmers, can you do it again? Yes. Come back to that team a year later. Can you get a feature working for us? Hmm, tricky! It's probably going to take us six months.

**Initial thought or note on:** [(View Highlight)](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfnqjg8aq3044gqk4315ej72)
1. Same Level of Abstraction:
- A function's lines should all operate at a similar conceptual level (e.g., high-level logic, low-level details, or a specific domain task).
- Mixing high-level reasoning with low-level implementation details in the same function can confuse the reader and make the function harder to understand or maintain.
2. One Level Below the Name:
- The function's name should represent what it does at a high level. The lines of code in the function should implement the "how" of the function at one level lower in detail.
3. Why It Matters:
- It ensures clarity and readability by aligning the implementation with the function's intent.
- It makes the function easier to understand, refactor, and test.
```python
def process_data(data):
filtered_data = filter_positive_values(data)
return calculate_average(filtered_data)
def filter_positive_values(data):
return [d for d in data if d > 0]
def calculate_average(data):
return sum(data) / len(data)
```

They would compile `.c` files into `.o` files (i.e. object files) and would collect all the files, and would then link all those `.o` files together into a `.exe` via the Makefile. Someone with the role/position of a "Make Master" (or similar titles like Build Engineer or Build System Maintainer) is crucial in software development projects that use low-level languages like C or assembly, where managing the build process can be particularly complex. This role is primarily focused on maintaining, optimizing, and troubleshooting the build system, often centered around tools like GNU Make or other build automation tools.
