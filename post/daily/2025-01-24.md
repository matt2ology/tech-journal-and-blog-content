<!-- Key observations and quick task for the day -->

### Accenture

Our ideas shape our lives. And none of our ideas shapes our lives more than our ideas of who we are, what philosophers call our "self-conceptions". Many of us struggle as adults to "find ourselves," to break free from our old, externally imposed self-conceptions and to arrive at new ones of our own choosing. But Daoism, a classical Chinese philosophy, warns us that all our concepts are cages. They impose limitation, take our freedom, cloud our vision. Some cages are more pleasant than others. But we're better off being free.

Rick Schubert explains the Daoist path to freedom; how we can use concepts to move past concepts, how we can use our cages as things to stand on so we can get a better view.

**Question:** How does the concept of the "bamboo ceiling" illustrate the limitations of externally imposed self-conceptions, and how might Daoist philosophy suggest transcending these barriers to achieve true freedom?
