## Categorization Guide for Photo Organization

Inspired from: [Scott Kelby’s SLIM (Simplified Lightroom Image Management) System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLX27yyDiIs&t=2836s&ab_channel=B%26HPhotoVideoProAudio)

**Also see:** [Photo Categorization Decision Tree](Photo%20Categorization%20Decision%20Tree.md)

### Quick Steps for Categorizing

1. **Ask the Context Question:** Is this photo about people, places, or events?
2. **Check the Occasion:** Was this taken for a specific purpose (e.g., a celebration, a trip)?
3. **Group by Relevance:** Does this photo relate to a theme, person, or moment already covered in your library?
4. **Use Tags/Lightroom Collections:** If a photo fits multiple categories, use tags/collections (e.g., "Travel," "Friends") for cross-referencing.

### Thematic Directory Folder Structure and Possible Sub-Themes

_Using Adobe's Lightroom Classic terminology_: `collections` should/often
mirror this structure; however, unlike `collections`, `folders`, are initial,
imposed, fixed, and siloed locations to place one's original copies of data/image
files for storage.

"`Collections`" are virtual references to the original copies of data/image files.
These "`collections`" can be stored with other "`collections`" in "`collection sets`".

After initial file storage (and the import) one should work only with `collections`,
for if you were to reorganize, duplicate , accidentally delete only the virtual
references (the `collections`) are affected and not one's own original copies
of the data/image files saved in the `folders` they were stored in.
