## Lightroom Classic Image Import and Organization

**Link to source:** [Lightroom Organization: A Comprehensive Guide](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/96c29c60-7405-4b55-8faa-204ade224a1f)

### Summary

This guide details a robust system for importing and organizing photos in Lightroom Classic, emphasizing a workflow that prioritizes safety and efficiency. It stresses the importance of using an **external hard drive** for photo storage and meticulously structuring files into topic-based folders before importing. The guide then explains how Lightroom's catalog functions as a database of image previews and edits, not a storage location, highlighting the crucial rule to **never move or rename files outside of Lightroom**. Finally, it champions using **Lightroom's collection sets and collections**, rather than the Folders panel, for flexible and safe organization, recommending best practices like using pick flags and star ratings to select and curate images. The ultimate goal is to maintain a well-structured, readily accessible, and secure digital photo library.

## Key Highlights

Here is a quick guide to importing images from an SD card into Lightroom Classic, based on the sources:

1. Initial Setup and File Storage

   - Before importing, ensure you have an external hard drive to store your photos. Storing photos on your computer's internal drive can lead to it filling up quickly.
   - Create a main folder on your external hard drive, such as "Photo Library". This will be the primary location for all your images.
   - Inside your main photo library folder, create topic-based folders that reflect your photography, such as "Travel", "Sports," or "Family".
   - When importing new images, copy them from your memory card directly into the relevant topic folder on your external drive.
     - Then create a subfolder within the topic folder for that specific shoot, for example "Yellow Long Sleeve Studio".

2. Importing into Lightroom Classic

   - After copying photos to the external drive, import them into Lightroom.
   - In the Lightroom Library module, click the Import button.
   - Navigate to the folder on your external drive containing the images.
   - Click "Import" to bring the photos into Lightroom.

3. Understanding Lightroom's Catalog

   - The Lightroom catalog is not where your photos are stored. It is a database that contains previews of your photos and edits.
   - The actual image files are located on your hard drive, preferably an external hard drive.
   - Lightroom creates a connection to your raw files where they are stored and needs to be aware of any changes to that location.
   - Do not move or rename files outside of Lightroom after they have been imported, as this can cause missing file errors.

4. Organizing within Lightroom

   - Create a collection set with a descriptive name that corresponds to your topic folder on your hard drive. For example, if your hard drive folder is named "Travel" create a collection set with the same name.
     - For new imports, create a collection set that corresponds to the specific shoot.
   - Inside the collection set, create a collection called "Full Shoot" containing all the images from the import.
   - Use Pick Flags (`P`) to quickly mark the good photos.
     - Use the right arrow to quickly go through images and press P for the photos that are in the running.
   - After reviewing the full shoot, create a new collection called "Picks" which contains all the images that were flagged with the pick flag.
   - Go through your "Picks" collection again, and give a 5-star rating to the best images you want to edit.
   - Create a final collection called "Selects" which contains all the 5-star rated images.

5. Using Collections Instead of Folders

   - Avoid using the Folders panel in Lightroom for organization.
   - The Folders panel reflects what is on your hard drive, and making changes there can cause you to lose photos.
   - Use collections for organization because they are safer, more powerful and versatile.
   - The same image can be in multiple collections, but with folders, the same image can only be in one folder at a time.
   - Collections are required to use Lightroom on mobile devices.
   - To convert folders to collections, right-click on the folder and select "Create Collection" or "Create Collection Set" if there are subfolders.

6. Key Points for Success
   - Always import to the external hard drive before adding images to the catalog.
   - Use descriptive names for your folders and files so you can easily search for images.
   - Do not organize by date, as Lightroom already does this automatically.
   - Back up your Lightroom catalog regularly.
   - Store your Lightroom catalog on your computer, not your external drive, for optimal performance.

By following these steps, you can efficiently import and organize your photos in Lightroom Classic while minimizing the risk of losing or misplacing your images.
