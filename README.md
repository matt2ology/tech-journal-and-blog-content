## These are my main priorities right now

I am open to considering new opportunities, for I am always looking to learn and develop a better perspective of new things. I aspire to stick to my priorities 90% of the time, as a result; I will say no to the majority of requests that come my way now. If my activities or priorities happen to change, I’ll update this page to reflect those changes.

Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now), [Thomas Frank](https://collegeinfogeek.com/), and [Sal Ferrarello](https://salferrarello.com/about/), this page is a public declaration and a reminder to myself that goals only become meaningful if work is put into its completion.
