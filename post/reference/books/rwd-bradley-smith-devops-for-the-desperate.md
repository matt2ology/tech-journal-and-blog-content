## Highlights

### Location 366

> DevOps is an integral part of software development.

**Initial thought or note on:** [(Location 366)](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09M82VY43&location=366)
Infrastructure as code for development of the product/services.

### Location 370

> Writing configuration files, enforcing observability, and setting up continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines have become the norm in software development. You therefore need to be well versed in code and infrastructure.

**Initial thought or note on:** [(Location 370)](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09M82VY43&location=370)
A component in extreme programming where the goal is to always push out features, have them integrated, and constantly delivered to the product/service. Extreme programming is an Agile project management methodology that targets speed and simplicity with short development cycles and less documentation.

The foundational concepts to DevOps

### Location 388

> DevOps practices and techniques with feature teams is paramount to delivering standardized and predictable software.

**Initial thought or note on:** [(Location 388)](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09M82VY43&location=388)
As engineering ecosystems mature, so does the team/corparation. Teams that do not share practices and techniques are siloed, and ignorant to how much their output affects others around them; for this reason, causes roadblocks, lapses in both the decision making process and communication, and an organization with conflicting expectations and accountability.

### Location 389

> DevSecOps is becoming an essential part of the build process rather than a post-release afterthought.
> \- [(Location 389)](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09M82VY43&location=389)

**Initial thought or note on:** [(Location 389)](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09M82VY43&location=389)
The developers are no longer separated from those who maintain the infrastructure: those who write the code and those who maintain the infrastructure the code runs on/the resources the code utilizes. The evolution of the developer moves away from the classical style of engineering production, siloed, waterfall paradigm model of work. This hands-on-everything approach is aligned with agile methodology for modern software projects leverages the cloud, Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, and containerizations. All of these elements, the infrastructure, can't be seen as just the invisable "backend", but is the foundations of the product/service for the end user.

### Location 403

> infrastructure as code (IaC) and configuration management (CM), which are essential for building systems with a repeatable, versioned, and predictable state.
> \- [(Location 403)](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09M82VY43&location=403)

### Location 541

> Vagrant uses a single configuration file, called a Vagrantfile, to describe the virtual environment in code. You’ll use this to create your local infrastructure.
> \- [(Location 541)](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09M82VY43&location=541)

### Location 556

> A Vagrantfile describes how to build and provision a VM. It’s best practice to use one Vagrantfile per project so you can add the configuration file to your project’s version control and share it with your team.

One configuration file per project. How does this compare with Nix?
