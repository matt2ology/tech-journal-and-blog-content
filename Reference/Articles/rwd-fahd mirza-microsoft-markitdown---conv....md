> Simply, we're importing Markdown, and then we are importing the open again. I'm instantiating this open's client and Markdown client. Then Markdown is also getting this LLM and the LLM is GPT-4. We already have set up our API key. This is a local image which I'm getting that I want to convert into the Markdown format. I am just printing the text down without markup, and then the actual markup format here, which I'm displaying.
