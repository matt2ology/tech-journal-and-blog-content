> content of the human mind can be classified into five categories:
>   1. **Data**: symbols 
>   2. **Information**: data that are processed to be useful; provides answers to "who", "what", "where", and "when" questions 
>   3. **Knowledge**: application of data and information; answers "how" questions 
>   4. **Understanding**: appreciation of "why" 
>   5. **Wisdom**: evaluated understanding.

Gosh already out of the gate the author creatively wrote in a way that made me read that sentence multiple times. I guess that is one way to have visitors spend more time on your website.
"Right now, knowledge management is one of the most talked-about and focused-on areas in the world. People are really paying a lot of attention to it."

> Only the fifth category, wisdom, deals with the future because it incorporates vision and design. With wisdom, people can create the future rather than just grasp the present and past. But achieving wisdom isn't easy; people must move successively through the other categories.

> **Data**... data is raw. It simply exists and has no significance beyond its existence (in and of itself). It can exist in any form, usable or not. It does not have meaning of itself. In computer parlance, a spreadsheet generally starts out by holding data.

> **Information**... information is data that has been given meaning by way of relational connection. This "meaning" can be useful, but does not have to be. In computer parlance, a relational database makes information from the data stored within it.

Knowledge is already "worked". It has gone through the process of "understanding" to be made consumable and can be collected for record in a domain of study, a library/journal, or one's own research.
This is taken as "fact" without making one go through the exercises to understand the underlying mechanics, nuances, and core principles; such that, one can then leverage the ability to abstract and apply the same “knowledge” to another application or scenario.

### id843928236

> **Understanding**... understanding is an interpolative and probabilistic process. It is cognitive and analytical. It is the process by which I can take knowledge and synthesize new knowledge from the previously held knowledge. The difference between understanding and knowledge is the difference between "learning" and "memorizing".

> Wisdom is a uniquely human state, or as I see it, wisdom requires one to have a soul, for it resides as much in the heart as in the mind. And a soul is something machines will never possess (or perhaps I should reword that to say, a soul is something that, in general, will never possess a machine).
