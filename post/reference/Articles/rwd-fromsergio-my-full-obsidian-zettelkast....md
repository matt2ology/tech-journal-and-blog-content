- **Literature Notes:** reference notes, the highlights, that are written in your own words
- **Permanent Notes:** are notes that atomic encapsulations of a particular example, thought, idea, concept, theory, etc. These notes can standalone independent of it's original context.

Your own writing and understanding allows you to build-up new examples (concrete and specific), thoughts (raw and personal), ideas (formed but still individual), concepts (organized and shareable), theories (systematic and evidence-based), and abstractions (universal and distilled)

So if you read a book, an academic paper, an article, whatever it may be, and you highlight stuff, those highlights are your reference notes. These notes should only have direct quotes of someone else's work and not your own. The whole point of having reference notes is to help us in writing literature notes

> keep two different files because while all the highlights I take make it to Obsidian, I try to put only the most relevant ones in the literature note. The fact that I keep two different files gives me permission to not be so selective with what to highlight. It lets me read more freely and really focus on the text itself instead of spending time thinking, "Should this really be highlighted, or maybe I should have."

You can merge your highlighted reference notes into your literature notes, but keeping the two separate affords you to expand, elaborate, or summarize key highlights into your literature notes. The literature note is a distilled high level summary of the reference note of the original source material.

This only works if you're using one of the two Obsidian supported link formats - **Wikilink**: `[[Three laws of motion]]`
[Link to a block in a note](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links#Link+to+a+block+in+a+note):
A block is a unit of text in your note, such as a paragraph, block quote, or list item.
You can link to a block by adding #^ at the end of your link destination followed by a unique block identifier. For example, `[[2023-01-01#^37066d]]`.
Fortunately, you don't need to know the identifier. When you type the caret (^), you can select the block from a list of suggestions to insert the correct identifier.

Sergio's literature notes for books is practically an outline of the book with chapter headers along with his key takeaways. He shares that even though some chapters are blank it doesn't mean that those corresponding chapters did not have highlights.
**The benefits of separating a reference note and a literature note:** he is very selective to what highlights are worth writing and mentioning about within his literature note of the source material.

Permanent notes are concepts and ideas independent of their original context; for, it is not a highlight of someone else's words or ideas and it is not our interpretation of someone else's words or ideas.
Permanent notes are atomic, standalone, can be applied to various applications, examples, and contribute (i.e. the building blocks) to new ideas, thoughts, and insights.

> a part where the author talked about the multitasking myth, which basically says that multitasking doesn’t work. When we think we’re multitasking, we’re actually switching between two tasks really quickly, and every time we switch, there’s a switch cost. This is something I agree with, and I have my own thoughts about it. So it prompted me to make a permanent note on it. At the time, I created the link, but I didn’t write the permanent note; I just linked it as I read it.

As you're writing in your own words the quotes from your reference note (i.e. the literature notes). From the literature note you can make an initial outward Wikilink (`[[Multi-tasking myth]]`) or Markdown link (`[Multi-tasking myth](Multi-tasking myth)`) of a particular idea or concept.

> I took on more content; I made literature notes on "Atomic Habits" by James Clear and "Flow" by Mihaly.
>   Three literature notes both ended up linking to multitasking. So later, once I saw that there were multiple links to that empty note, I started writing it. I already had so much to write about because I had already thought and written about it before. This is why it’s commonly said that in the Zettelkasten system, you never start from scratch. As your Vault grows, you’ll see clusters forming in your graph view, and some of these clusters will likely be around notes you haven’t even written yet. But when you have multiple notes all pointing to one single link, it becomes virtually impossible to not take action and write a permanent note about

**Initial thought or note on:** [(View Highlight)](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je8b153majp3tmeex42v85cc)
The initial outward Wikilink (`[[Multi-tasking myth]]`) or Markdown link (`[Multi-tasking myth](Multi-tasking myth)`) from the literature note links to a note that has not yet been created. You can create it once you have gathered enough literature notes to develop a holistic, comprehensive, in-depth, multifaceted, and interconnected understanding of the idea or concept. At that point, you can distill an atomic, standalone, context-independent encapsulation of his own "wisdom" of the idea or concept.
In Sergio's example the three literature notes on "How to Take Smart Notes" by Sonke Ahrens, "Atomic Habits" by James Clear, and "Flow" by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi provided Sergio a general consensus and idea to how or why Multi-tasking myth as an internal link to the permanent note (via Wikilink: `[[Multi-tasking myth]]` or Markdown link: `[Multi-tasking myth](Multi-tasking myth)`).

> The first is that they should be atomic, which means one note, one idea. Secondly, they should be short and concise as possible. I make it so I don’t have to scroll down to see the full note, because generally speaking, if I need to scroll to see the full note, I mean, it's not clear enough or I’m Covering more than one idea, it should be easy to understand by anyone, even if it pulls information from two or three different literature nodes.
>   Someone with just basic knowledge of the topic at hand should be able to understand it. As Sunk has said in the book, permanent notes are directed towards an audience ignorant of the thoughts behind the text and unaware of the original context, only equipped with the general knowledge of the field. Lastly, I do my best to have at least one link in each permanent note. This of course isn’t possible when you’re just starting, but it’s something to keep in mind as your vault grows, because that’s what adds real value to our system. It’s

**Initial thought or note on:** [(View Highlight)](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je8bz5qyqjcqseh3e99qngnz)
Components of a good quality permanent note are:
1. The note is atomic: the note encapsulates 1 and only 1 idea or concept.
2. The note is short and concise as much as possible (i.e. the content should be above the fold: you should not have to scroll to gain understanding). It should be relatively easy to understand by anyone ignorant of the field, topic, domain, and/or original context.
3. The permanent note,via Wikilink: `[[Multi-tasking myth]]` or Markdown link: `[Multi-tasking myth](Multi-tasking myth)`, internally links out to at least one (or more) permanent note.

> "Why bother with any of this if you don't want to have published work?" There are so many benefits to doing this. Your notes and thoughts will compound over time, giving you insights and connections you wouldn't find otherwise. You'll become a better thinker, which turns you into a better speaker because you're able to better articulate your thoughts. And no matter what you do or plan to do, being a good writer will probably help.

**Initial thought or note on:** [(View Highlight)](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je8crh6bj306jtcyydvtr1sp)
Logical fallacy - "affirming the consequent"? No, the fallacy occurs when someone assumes that because a consequent (effect) is true, the antecedent (cause) must also be true.
It follows this invalid logical structure:
```plaintext
1. If P, then Q.
2. Q.
3. Therefore, P.
```
**It has some potential Issues in that it may lead to**:
- Hasty Generalization: some people may become better speakers or writers through other means (e.g., practice, feedback) without engaging in extensive note-taking or reflective thought.
- Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc (Causal Fallacy): the statement implies a causal relationship: notes and thoughts compounding → better thinking → better speaking/writing.
- Appeal to General Utility (Implicit Assumption): the statement claims, "No matter what you do, being a good writer will probably help." While broadly true, this is an overgeneralization. Some professions or activities may benefit very little from strong writing skills (e.g., physical labor jobs), so the universal applicability is questionable.
