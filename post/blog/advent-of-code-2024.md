## Advent of Code 2024

<!-- [Propose edits or changes on GitHub](link to GitHub repo of file) -->

I am terrible of thinking up my own "software project". I don't have much in
my life that requires a constant stream of unique digital solutions.

Thinking that all elements of my own life requires a solution that needs
to be on the cloud and leverages generative AI is the same logical fallacy
that all problems can be resolved with a hammer... Well yes, but my gosh.

So like many times in past I'll start [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
to have a defined problem to build a solution towards.

Unlike the past I'm no longer balancing work, school, and life.

Now graduated, with a job, I now have the luxury, the privilege, to live to
work instead of working to live.

The barrier to entry is [earning that first degree](https://www.ppic.org/publication/is-college-worth-it/#:~:text=Society%20benefits%20from%20higher%20education,-Higher%20education%20is&text=In%20addition%20to%20having%20higher,poverty%20or%20need%20social%20services.)

All developments in my journey of last years, 2024, Advent of Code in Python
can be found here: <https://github.com/matt2ology/advent-of-code-2024-python>

### The goal

To avoid disappointing myself and falling into a spiral of self-loathing
and despair, I will prescribe the smallest possible dosage—the simplest,
most achievable goal—to address my ignorance.

1. Practice problem solving with Python without the help of GitHub Copilot
2. Practice Test Driven Development (TDD)
   1. First write the test - fail
   2. Write a passing solution/implementation
   3. Refactor the code (i.e. restructure the code without changing its functionality)
      1. If-statements become functions
      2. A collection of similar functions or modification of common variables becomes a class
3. Learn and use [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) as my testing framework

At any point that I have the "I get it" feeling I am at no obligation to
continue the goal is to practice and document my learning.

Finishing all Advent of Code's challenges is not necessary; for, the goal
is to come out of this knowing more than I did before.

#### Stretch goals

These goals are ideally more attune to "someday-maybes" and no promise
to anyone or anybody else that I'll have them completed.

- Do the same practice in [Golang](https://go.dev/) and its environment
- Do the same practice in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and its environment
- Do the same, but practice using Python's own, built-in, `unittest`
- Do the same, but implement a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
