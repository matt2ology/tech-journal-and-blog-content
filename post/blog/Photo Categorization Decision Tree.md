## Photo Categorization Decision Tree

Inspired from: [Scott Kelby’s SLIM (Simplified Lightroom Image Management) System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLX27yyDiIs&t=2836s&ab_channel=B%26HPhotoVideoProAudio)

**Also see:** [Categorization Guide for Photo Organization](Categorization%20Guide%20for%20Photo%20Organization.md)

Here’s a decision tree to help categorize your photos systematically. You can follow this flowchart to quickly decide where a photo or series of photos should be placed:

## Visual Representation (Summary)

- **START**:
  ↓
  **Is it an Event or Gathering?**
  → Yes → **Events**
  → No →
  **Is it focused on People?**
  → Yes → **Family, Friends, or Portraiture**
  → No →
  **Is it related to Travel or Adventure?**
  → Yes → **Travel**
  → No →
  **Is it Artistic or Creative Work?**
  → Yes → **Photography Projects**
  → No → **Miscellaneous**

## Photo Categorization Decision Tree Descriptive

### 1. What is the primary focus of the photo(s)?

- **An Event or Gathering?** → Go to **Step 2**
- **Specific People?** → Go to **Step 3**
- **Travel or Adventure?** → Go to **Step 4**
- **Artistic or Creative Work?** → Go to **Step 5**
- **Unclear or Miscellaneous?** → Place in **Miscellaneous**

---

### 2. For Event or Gathering: What type of event is it?

- **Celebrations (birthdays, weddings, graduations)?** → Place in **Events > Celebrations**
- **Concerts, theater, or performances?** → Place in **Events > Concerts and Performances**
- **Cultural, social, or political events (parades, fairs, marches)?** → Place in **Events > Cultural and Social Events**
- **School, university, or work-related?** → Place in **Events > School and University** or **Work and Corporate**

---

### 3. For Specific People: What is the relationship to you?

- **Immediate family (your parents, siblings, grandparents, etc.)?** → Place in **Family**
- **Significant other or their family?** → Place in **Friends > Girlfriend/Partner’s Family** (or **Close Relations** if a top-level folder exists)
- **Friends or colleagues?**
  - **Casual hangouts or reunions?** → Place in **Friends > Hangouts** or **Reunions**
  - **Formal or creative portraits?** → Place in **People > Portraiture**

---

### 4. For Travel or Adventure: Where was it taken?

- **Day trip or local exploration?** → Place in **Travel > Local Adventures**
- **Within the country but outside your region?** → Place in **Travel > National Travel**
- **Outside the country?** → Place in **Travel > International Travel**

---

### 5. For Artistic or Creative Work: What is the purpose?

- **Semi-structured (route planned) or experiments?** → Place in **Photography Projects > Photowalks**
- **Casual Unstructured wandering?** → Place in **Photography Projects > Flâneur Photography**
- **Formal projects or exhibitions?** → Place in **Photography Projects > Exhibitions**
- **Experimental or technical?** → Place in **Photography Projects > Experimentation**

| **Aspect**          | **Flâneur Photography**      | **Candid Photography**         | **Street Photography**         | **Photowalks**                  |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------- | :----------------------------- | :----------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| **Primary Goal**    | Personal, poetic observation | Authentic, spontaneous moments | Storytelling, societal insight | Exploration or practice         |
| **Focus on People** | Optional                     | Common                         | Common                         | Optional                        |
| **Setting**         | Urban, reflective            | Any                            | Public spaces                  | Any (depends on chosen route)   |
| **Intent**          | Emotional connection         | Unposed authenticity           | Document or interpret culture  | Practice or community building  |
| **Structure**       | Unstructured wandering       | Unplanned, opportunistic       | Intentional observation        | Semi-structured (route planned) |

#### Overlap

- **Candid Photography and Street Photography** often overlap, with street photography focusing more on the broader narrative.
- **Flâneur Photography** can happen during a photowalk but is more introspective.
- **Photowalks** can incorporate any of the above styles, depending on the photographer's goals.

### 6. For Unclear or Miscellaneous Photos

- **Experimental or one-off projects?** → Place in **Miscellaneous > Miscellaneous Projects**
- **Random shots?** → Place in **Miscellaneous > Random Moments**
- **Specific products, items, or objects?** → Place in **Miscellaneous > Products**
