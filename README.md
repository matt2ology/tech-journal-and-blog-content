## These are my main priorities right now

I am open to considering new opportunities, for I am always looking to learn and develop a better perspective of new things. I aspire to stick to my priorities 90% of the time, as a result; I will say no to the majority of requests that come my way now. If my activities or priorities happen to change, Iâ€™ll update this page to reflect those changes. Last update was July 19, 2020. Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now), [Thomas Frank](https://collegeinfogeek.com/), and [Sal Ferrarello](https://salferrarello.com/about/), this page is a public declaration and a reminder to myself that goals only become meaningful if work is put into its completion.
